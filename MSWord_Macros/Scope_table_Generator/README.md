## Creating the Scope Table Macro in Microsoft Word

Follow these steps to create a Word macro that generates a customized table for IP addresses.

### Step 1: Create UserForm1
1. Press `Alt` + `F11` to open the VBA editor.
2. Click "Insert" > "UserForm" to create a new UserForm.
3. Add a TextBox (name it `TextBox1`) for IP address input.
4. Add a CommandButton and double-click it to add the following code:
   ```vba
   Private Sub CommandButton1_Click()
       ScopeTable TextBox1.Text
       Unload Me
   End Sub
   ```

### Step 2: Create Module1
1. Click "Insert" > "Module" to create a new module.
2. Name the module "Module1".
3. Copy and paste the `ScopeTable` code from the file you saved earlier into Module1.

### Step 3: Create a Ribbon Button
1. Right-click the ribbon and choose "Customize the Ribbon."
2. Choose "Macros" from the "Choose commands from" dropdown.
3. Add a new group to the ribbon and add the `ShowIPForm` macro to the group.
4. Customize the button as needed and click "OK."

### Step 4: Usage
1. Click the ribbon button to open the UserForm.
2. Paste a list of IP addresses into the TextBox (one per line).
3. Click the command button to insert the "Scope" table into the document.

## Troubleshooting

### If You Get This Error:
"The macro can't be found or has been disabled because of your Macro security settings."

Follow these steps to try to resolve the issue:

1. **Check Macro Security Settings**:
   - In Word, go to "File" > "Options" > "Trust Center" > "Trust Center Settings" > "Macro Settings."
   - Select "Disable all macros with notification" or a less restrictive option.
   - Click "OK" and restart Word.

2. **Enable the Macro**:
   - Open the `.docm` file containing the macro.
   - If you see a security warning bar near the top of the window, click "Enable Content" or "Enable Macros."

3. **Save the Document in a Trusted Location** (Optional):
   - You can create a trusted location in Word where documents are allowed to run macros without restrictions.
   - In the Trust Center settings, go to "Trusted Locations" and add the folder where your `.docm` file is located.

4. **Check Macro Name and Location**:
   - Ensure that the macro is saved in the correct module and has the correct name as referenced in your code.
   - Press `Alt` + `F11` to open the VBA editor and verify that the macro is present in the expected location.

5. **Save as a Global Template** (Optional):
   - If you want the macro to be available across all Word documents, you can save the macro in the Word global template (`Normal.dotm`).
   - Copy the macro code and UserForm into the `Normal.dotm` file in the VBA editor.

> Note: Adjusting macro security settings can expose your system to risks from malicious macros, so it's important to be cautious with files from unknown or untrusted sources.
