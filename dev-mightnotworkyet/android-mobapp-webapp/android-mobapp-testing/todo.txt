
Alright, let's break down the implementation for each feature:



2. Logs and Debugging:
You can fetch real-time logs using the adb logcat command.

Implementation Steps:

Run the adb logcat command in the background.
Capture the output and display it in a scrollable area on your web interface.
Provide filtering options for the user to narrow down the logs based on tags, log levels, etc.




3. File Management:
This involves pushing and pulling files to and from the device.

Implementation Steps:

Provide an interface for the user to select files from their computer.
Use adb push to push files to the device and adb pull to retrieve files.
Display the file structure of the device, allowing the user to choose where to push files or from where to pull them.




4. Shell Access:
Allow users to run custom ADB shell commands.

Implementation Steps:

Provide a text input area where users can type in their shell commands.
Use the adb shell command followed by the user's input to execute the command.
Display the output in a designated area on the web interface.
